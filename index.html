            <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data 
                structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant 
                syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for
                 scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.</p>

            <p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or 
                binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, https://www.python.org/, 
                and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to 
                many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.</p>
            
            <p>The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or 
                C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for 
                customizable applications.</p>

            <p>So far there are 3 main versions of Python:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Version 1. Reached in January 1994. </li>
                <li>Version 2. Released October 2000</li>
                <li>Version 3. Released on December 2008</li>
            </ul>

            <header>Invoking the Python Interpreter</header>
            <p>The Python interpreter is usually installed as <code>/usr/local/bin/python3.9</code> on those machines 
                where it 
                is available; putting <code>/usr/local/bin</code> in your Unix shell’s search path makes it possible to start 
                it by typing the command:</p>
                <code>python3.9</code>
            <p>On Windows machines where you have installed Python from the Microsoft Store, the python3.9 command will be available. If you have the py.exe launcher installed, you can use the py command.</p>

            <header>First Steps Towards Programing</header>
            <p>We can use Python for more complicated tasks than adding two and two together. 
                For instance, we can write an initial sub-sequence of the Fibonacci series as follows:</p>
            <code>>>> # Fibonacci series: <br>
                ... # the sum of two elements defines the next <br>
                ... a, b = 0, 1 <br>
                >>> while a < 10: <br>
                ...     print(a) <br>
                ...     a, b = b, a+b <br>
                ... <br>
                0 <br>
                1 <br>
                1 <br>
                2 <br>
                3 <br>
                5 <br>
                8</code>

            <ul>
                <li>The first line contains a multiple assignment: the variables a and b simultaneously get the new values 0 and 1. On the last line this is used again, demonstrating that the expressions on the right-hand side are all evaluated first before any of the assignments take place. The right-hand side expressions are evaluated from the left to the right.</li>
                <li>The while loop executes as long as the condition (here: a < 10) remains true. In Python, like in C, any non-zero integer value is true; zero is false. The condition may also be a string or list value, in fact any sequence; anything with a non-zero length is true, empty sequences are false. The test used in the example is a simple comparison. The standard comparison operators are written the same as in C: < (less than), > (greater than), == (equal to), <= (less than or equal to), >= (greater than or equal to) and != (not equal to).</li>
                <li>The body of the loop is indented: indentation is Python’s way of grouping statements. At the interactive prompt, you have to type a tab or space(s) for each indented line. In practice you will prepare more complicated input for Python with a text editor; all decent text editors have an auto-indent facility. When a compound statement is entered interactively, it must be followed by a blank line to indicate completion (since the parser cannot guess when you have typed the last line). Note that each line within a basic block must be indented by the same amount.</li>

        <section class="main-section" id="if_Statements">
            <header><code>if</code> Statements</header>
            <p>Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the if statement. For example:</p>
            <code>>>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
                Please enter an integer: 42 <br>
                >>> if x < 0: <br>
                ...     x = 0 <br>
                ...     print('Negative changed to zero') <br>
                ... elif x == 0: <br>
                ...     print('Zero') <br>
                ... elif x == 1: <br>
                ...     print('Single') <br>
                ... else: <br>
                ...     print('More') <br>
                ... <br>
            </code>
            <p>There can be zero or more elif parts, and the else part is optional. The keyword ‘elif’ is short for ‘else if’, and is useful to avoid excessive indentation. An if … elif … elif … sequence is a substitute for the switch or case statements found in other languages.</p>
        </section>
        <hr>

        <section class="main-section" id="for_Statements">
            <header><code>for</code> Statements</header>
            <p>The for statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python’s for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence.</p>
            <code># Measure some strings: <br>
                words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate'] <br>
                for w in words: <br>
                    print(w, len(w))
            </code>
            <p>Code that modifies a collection while iterating over that same collection can be tricky to get right. Instead, it is usually more straight-forward to loop over a copy of the collection or to create a new collection</p>
